### How to use
* Install [Cockatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/releases/latest).
* Open Cockatrice and follow the setup instructions. Since you don't need any of these files, you can save them to a custom location and delete them later.
* When prompted to the sets management window, hit `Disable all sets`.
* Download `sv_cards.xml` and `sv_tokens.xml`. You can save them anywhere, but for convenience it's recommended that you place them in the same directory as the files you downloaded initially.
* `Cockatrice > Settings > General > Paths > Card Database`: select`sv_cards.xml`.
* `Cockatrice > Settings > General > Paths > Token Database`: select `sv_tokens.xml`.
* `Cockatrice > Card Database > Manage Sets`: disable the `Token` set.
